# PredictSport - MVP Punch List

Priority order. Mirrors SPEC.md §15. **Keep both files in sync.**

Audit date: 2026-05-09.

## P0 — Blocking launch

- [x] §15.1 — Fix Google OAuth on deployed app (redirect URL config)
- [x] §15.2 — User profile page (display name, avatar, notification prefs)
- [x] §15.3 — Competition activation UI (draft → active button in admin)
- [x] §15.4 — Competition completion/archive flow in admin

## P1 — Core functionality gaps

- [x] §15.5 — H2H draw support: `allow_draw` config, draw option in UI, scorer update
- [x] §15.6 — Over/under push handling: exact line hit → void (null), not wrong
- [x] §15.7 — UI vocabulary: rename "The Damage" → "Results", "The Sheet" → "The Round", review AI-generated copy
- [x] §15.8 — Web push notifications (replaced WhatsApp; PWA-based reminders, results)

## P2 — Polish & quality of life

- [x] §15.11 — Persona callout configuration in settings

## Post-Launch

- [x] **Schema Normalisation Audit & Code Review** — Full BCNF analysis and realignment. Key issues: (1) `predictions` lacks FK to `event_prediction_types` — should use `event_prediction_type_id` not text `(event_id, prediction_type)`; (2) `events.competition_id` transitively determined by `events.round_id`; (3) `events.prediction_types` JSONB dead weight — confirm dropped; (4) fixture metadata duplicated on `events` — no `sporting_event_id` FK to `sporting_events` pool. Full BCNF review of all tables, write migration(s), realign all code to new FKs.

## Personal Predictions Unification

Design complete. See `docs/DESIGN-PERSONAL-PREDICTIONS-UNIFICATION.md`. Implement in order below.

### Phase A — Migration (foundation, do first)

- [x] **A1 — Personal competition bootstrap migration** — SQL migration: for each existing `users` row, insert one `competitions` row (`type='personal'`, `status='active'`, `scoring_rules='{}'`, `name='Personal'`) and one `competition_members` row (`role='admin'`). Add `type` check constraint to include `'personal'`. Add unique constraint: one personal competition per user.
- [x] **A2 — Port legacy rows migration** — SQL migration: for each `personal_predictions` row, upsert an `events` row (keyed by `external_event_id` + `competition_id`), insert `event_prediction_types` rows (`winner` always; `exact_score` if `score_prediction` was set, `points=0`), insert `predictions` rows from `prediction_value` + `score_prediction`. Preserve `result_confirmed` where result was known.
- [x] **A3 — Drop legacy table migration** — Drop `personal_predictions` table and all associated cron jobs / API routes that write to it. Remove dead code.
- [x] **A4 — Add `favourite_team` to users** — SQL migration: add `favourite_team jsonb` column to `users` (stores `{sport, team_name, provider_id}`). Nullable — opt-in only.

### Phase B — Backend / API

- [x] **B1 — Personal competition resolver** — Server util `getOrCreatePersonalCompetition(userId)` — looks up the user's personal competition, creates it if missing (handles new signups post-migration). Used by all personal prediction API routes.
- [x] **B2 — Personal event creation API** — `POST /api/personal-predictions/event` — atomically creates `events` + `event_prediction_types` rows for a fixture in the user's personal competition. Idempotent on `external_event_id`. Returns event + prediction types.
- [x] **B3 — Personal prediction submit API** — `POST /api/personal-predictions/predict` — upserts a `predictions` row. No lock time enforcement (personal predictions can be changed freely before event starts).
- [x] **B4 — Outright creation API** — `POST /api/personal-predictions/outrights` — creates a `final_standings` prediction for a league/tournament (stored as an event with `is_outright=true` flag or separate `outright_predictions` table — decide at implementation). Handles change budget (max 3 total, timestamped history).
- [x] **B5 — Inferred suggestions API** — `GET /api/personal-predictions/outright-suggestions` — returns leagues where user has 3+ fixture picks but no outright, filtered to those not dismissed or dismissed but now at 10+ picks.
- [x] **B6 — Dashboard stats API** — `GET /api/personal-predictions/stats` — returns: lifetime hit rate + streak, by-sport breakdown, by-league breakdown, by-year breakdown, recent 5 picks with results. Aggregates from `predictions` join `events` on personal competition.

### Phase C — Fixtures Tab (replace legacy browser)

- [x] **C1 — New PersonalFixtureBrowser component** — Replace legacy 1,412-LOC `PersonalFixtureBrowser.tsx` with unified-model version. Fixture tap → calls B2 + B3 atomically. Same provider/league browsing UX, but writes to competition model.
- [x] **C2 — Sport-aware prediction type defaults** — Util `getPersonalDefaults(sport, format)`: team sports → `winner` + `exact_score` as primary, 2-3 extra pills; race sports → `winner` only. Wire into B2.
- [x] **C3 — Familiar terminology pills** — Map internal types to pill labels: `exact_score` → "Correct Score", `margin` → "Winning Margin", `over_under` → "Over/Under", `handicap` → "Spread", `head_to_head` → "H2H", `yes_no` → "Prop Bet", `top_n` → "Top 3", `progression` → "To Qualify", `final_standings` → "Outright Winner". Apply across personal predictions UI.
- [x] **C4 — Contextual outright card in Fixtures tab** — When browsing a specific league, show a contextual card at top: "Who wins [League]?" if no outright exists. Tapping creates the outright via B4.

### Phase D — Outrights Tab

- [x] **D1 — Outrights tab scaffold** — New tab in personal predictions nav. Lists all user's active outright picks with status (open, resolved, pending resolution).
- [x] **D2 — Inferred suggestions section** — Secondary section in Outrights tab. Calls B5. Shows dismissable suggestion cards ("You've picked 4 Premier League games — who wins the title?"). Dismissal stored per user per league.
- [x] **D3 — Outright change rules UX** — Before tournament start: freely editable. After start: show change budget (e.g. "2 changes remaining"), timestamped history inline. UX discourages flipping (confirm dialog).

### Phase E — Dashboard Tab

- [x] **E1 — Dashboard tab scaffold + stats fetch** — New tab. Calls B6. Renders fixed widget order: Recent Picks → Summary Strip → By Year → By Sport → By League.
- [x] **E2 — Recent Picks widget** — Last 5 picks in super-compact single-card view (one line per pick: team badge, result icon, sport tag). Expandable dropdown to show all. Correct/wrong/pending colour coding.
- [x] **E3 — Summary Strip widget** — Lifetime stats row: total picks, % correct, current streak, best streak.
- [x] **E4 — By Year/Season widget** — Year selector (2024 / 2025 / 2026). Shows hit rate for selected year. Auto-defaults to current year.
- [x] **E5 — By Sport widget** — Hit rate per sport as a simple ranked list (Football 64%, GAA 71%, ...). Tap sport to drill into By League.
- [x] **E6 — By League widget** — Drill-down view within a sport. Hit rate per league/competition. Triggered by tapping a sport in E5.
- [x] **E7 — My Favourite Team widget** — Opt-in. If `users.favourite_team` is set: show recent pick history for that team + next upcoming fixture. If not set: show a small "Set a favourite team" prompt card.
- [x] **E8 — Customise button (placeholder)** — "Customise" button in dashboard header. For now shows a toast: "Widget reordering coming soon." Lays the groundwork (widget order stored in `users.notification_prefs` or new `dashboard_prefs` column).

### Phase F — Onboarding

- [x] **F1 — Favourite team prompt at signup** — After first successful login (detect via `created_at` within last 60s or a `onboarding_complete` flag), show a one-time modal: "Got a favourite team? We'll track your picks for them." Sport selector + team name input. Saves to `users.favourite_team`. Skippable.
- [x] Event nominations by participants (submission UI)
- [x] Public competition browsing/discovery page
- [x] Tiebreaker submission UI
- [x] Co-admin appointment UI
- [x] "New Season" clone from archived competition

## Manual Events & API Coverage (2026-05-12)

See `MANUAL-EVENTS-AND-API-GAPS.md` for detailed task breakdown.

### Phase 3: Manual Event Management (3-4 hours) — **INDEPENDENT, can run parallel to Phase 1/2**

**Admin Workflow Improvements**
- [x] 3.1 — Audit existing manual event creation flow (AddEventForm.tsx) — AddEventForm replaced by ManualEventWizard; orphaned file deleted
- [x] 3.2 — Design ManualEventWizard component (5-step guided creation)
- [x] 3.3 — Add team name validation & autocomplete suggestions
- [x] 3.4 — Create manual event templates (GAA, soccer, snooker, etc.)
- [x] 3.5 — Build bulk manual event creator (CSV upload or multi-row form)
- [x] 3.6 — Improve manual result entry UX (pre-populate, validation, preview) — pre-pop from event name, score preview, edit button, 2-step confirmation
- [x] 3.7 — Add result undo/edit capability (10-min window) — unlimited undo via unconfirm-result API (window constraint dropped; better UX for small groups)
- [x] 3.8 — Add "Events Missing Results" admin alert dashboard

- [x] 3.10 — Add "Duplicate Event" cloning feature
- [x] 3.11 — Validation before round/competition activation (pre-flight checks)
- [x] 3.12 — Documentation & inline help (tooltips, admin guide)

### Phase 4: Sports API Coverage Analysis (2-3 hours) — **INDEPENDENT, run Phase 4.1-4.8 first**

**Research & Integration (prioritized by audit)**
- [x] 4.1 — Audit current provider success rates (script + report)
- [x] 4.2 — Identify high-priority gaps (frequency × manual_rate)
- [ ] 4.3 — Research Cricket API alternatives (Cricbuzz, CricAPI, etc.)
- [ ] 4.4 — Research GAA API improvements (ClubZap, GAA.ie scraping)
- [ ] 4.5 — Evaluate Rugby League sources (NRL, Super League APIs)
- [ ] 4.6 — Research Athletics APIs (World Athletics, Tilastopaja)
- [ ] 4.7 — Evaluate Snooker coverage improvements (Snooker.org, CueTracker)
- [ ] 4.8 — Cost-benefit analysis for paid APIs (ROI calculation)
- [ ] 4.9 — Create provider integration guide (docs for contributors)
- [ ] 4.10 — Implement top-priority provider (TBD based on 4.8 ROI)
- [ ] 4.11 — Add provider health monitoring dashboard

**Recommended sequencing:**
1. Complete Phase 1 ✅
2. Run Phase 4.1-4.8 (audit & research, async)
3. Implement Phase 3 (immediate admin UX win)
4. Decide on Phase 2 (based on Phase 1 feedback)
5. Implement Phase 4.9-4.12 (data-driven, after audit)

## Sports Data Architecture Overhaul (2026-05-14)

See `SPORTS-ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed spec (TBD).

### Phase 5: Sport/League Decoupling — **BLOCKING for multi-league sports accuracy**

**Background:** Current model has one ESPN path per `Sport` type (e.g. `cricket/8048` = IPL only). MLB/NFL/NBA/NHL are leagues, not sports. An event picked from one league (e.g. Big Bash League) will fail to fetch results because the provider uses the wrong path.

**Phase 5.1 — Data model changes**
- [x] 5.1a — Add `provider_league` column to `personal_predictions` (stored at pick time)
- [x] 5.1b — Add `provider_league` column to `events` table (stored when event is created)
- [x] 5.1c — Add `result_provider` column to `personal_predictions` (which API returned the result)
- [x] 5.1d — Migration + RLS policy updates

**Phase 5.2 — Sport type renames**
- [ ] 5.2a — Rename `mlb` → `baseball`, `nfl` → `american_football`, `nba` → `basketball`, `nhl` → `ice_hockey` in `Sport` type
- [ ] 5.2b — Update `SPORT_PATHS`, `registry.ts`, all provider `supportedSports` arrays
- [ ] 5.2c — Update DB `sport` column values in all existing rows (migration)
- [ ] 5.2d — Update UI labels, fixture browser sport selector

**Phase 5.3 — Provider routing by league**
- [x] 5.3a — Pass `providerLeague` (e.g. `"cricket/8048"`) through `fetchResult()` signature
- [x] 5.3b — Update `ESPNProvider.getResult()` to accept and use stored league path
- [x] 5.3c — Store `result_provider` when result is saved in personal_predictions + events
- [x] 5.3d — Remove MLBStats from MLB provider chain (ESPN IDs ≠ MLB gamePk)

### Phase 6: Data Quality & Reliability

- [x] 6.1 — **Reset stale MLB picks** — nulled and re-fetched via cron after ESPN `is_final` fix (2026-05-15)
- [x] 6.2 — **Resolve null cricket results** — RCB v KKR (id `0e435b0e`, ESPN id `1529300`) and Punjab Kings v Mumbai Indians (id `66750591`, ESPN id `1529301`) — fixed via ESPN `state=post` bug fix (2026-05-15)
- [x] 6.3 — **Add result-fetch cron job** — `/api/personal-predictions/cron`, runs 3am UTC daily, also fixed ESPN `is_final` bug so results actually resolve (2026-05-15)
- [x] 6.4 — **Provider success rate audit** — confirmed via cron re-fetch: MLB and cricket now resolving correctly after ESPN `is_final` fix (2026-05-15)

### Phase 7: Cricket Fixture Cards Fix

**Problem:** Cricket event fixture cards show no Home/Draw/Away buttons. `config.options` is empty/missing on `winner` prediction type — prediction form falls back to free-text.

**Investigation checklist:**

- [ ] 7.1 — Check `AddEventForm.tsx`: does fixture → event creation correctly wire `fixture.participants` into `config.options` for the `winner` prediction type? Check `parseWinnerOptions` is called with participants, not just the event name string.
- [ ] 7.2 — Query existing cricket events to confirm `config.options` is empty:
  ```sql
  SELECT e.event_name, ept.prediction_type, ept.config
  FROM events e JOIN event_prediction_types ept ON ept.event_id = e.id
  WHERE e.sport = 'cricket' ORDER BY e.created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
  ```
- [ ] 7.3 — Confirm `allow_draw: false` for cricket (no draw in cricket). `parseWinnerOptions` in `src/lib/parse-options.ts` already handles this — verify it's being called correctly.
- [ ] 7.4 — Confirm `exact_score` is excluded for cricket. Check `supportsExactScore()` (likely `src/lib/sports/scoring.ts`).
- [ ] 7.5 — Fix: ensure admin event creation populates `config: { options: ["Team A", "Team B"] }` from `fixture.participants`.
- [ ] 7.6 — Backfill any existing broken cricket events with correct `config.options`.

**Expected result:** Cricket winner prediction renders two pill buttons (Team A / Team B), no Draw, no exact score.

## World Cup 2026 — Elimination Curve Implementation

> Source: `predictsport-world-cup-2026-elimination-curve-solution.md` (design), `docs/AUDIT-elimination-curve-solution.md` (audit). SPEC.md §16.8 (locked spec). ADR 0008 (resolved).

### Phase WC-E — Curve Generator & Storage

- [ ] **WC-E1 — Formula-based curve generator** — `src/lib/tournament/format/curve-generator.ts`: Implement `generateEliminationCurve(entrantCount: number)` per the pseudocode in the audit appendix. Accepts 8-96. Returns ordered array of `{ stage, remaining }`. Must pass all 16 test cases from the design doc + 6 edge cases from the audit.
- [ ] **WC-E2 — Curve storage format migration** — Update `classification.config.elimination_curve` from stage-keyed `Record<string, { target_survivors }>` to ordered array format `{ entrantCount, locked, curve: [{ stage, remaining }], groupAllocation, qualificationRules }`. Migration must be backward-compatible (existing data can be null/empty for non-tournament competitions).
- [ ] **WC-E3 — Replace `getEliminationCurveForPreset()`** — In `create-world-cup-competition.ts`, replace the hard-coded preset lookup table with a call to the new formula generator. Remove the preset-only constraint.
- [ ] **WC-E4 — Merge PW8/PW9** — In `create-world-cup-competition.ts`, merge Third-Place Play-Off and Final into a single Prediction Window (PW8). Update `PREDICTION_WINDOWS` array from 9 entries to 8. Update `STAGE_IDS` accordingly.

### Phase WC-F — Group Allocation & Qualification

- [ ] **WC-F1 — Target-aware group allocation** — Rewrite `src/lib/tournament/format/group-allocation.ts` `allocatePredictionGroups()` to implement the deterministic algorithm from the design doc S22.4. Must handle groups of 3, 4, and 5 entrants. Must be target-aware (choose group sizes to reach the survivor target).
- [ ] **WC-F2 — Group-size-aware best-third ranking** — Update `src/lib/tournament/format/scoring.ts` `computeBestThirdRanking()` to filter by group size: exclude thirds from 3-player groups (never qualify), exclude thirds from 5-player groups (auto-qualify, not in the best-third pool), only include thirds from 4-player groups.
- [ ] **WC-F3 — Rewrite elimination logic** — Update `src/lib/tournament/format/elimination.ts` `eliminateFromFormat()` to implement the full qualification rules: top 2 auto-qualify, 5-player thirds auto-qualify, 3-player thirds never qualify, best-third from 4-player groups only. Variable best-third pool size.
- [ ] **WC-F4 — Curve reader update** — Update `getEliminationCurve()` in `elimination.ts` to read the new array-format curve from classification config instead of the old stage-keyed map.

### Phase WC-G — Consequence Table & UI

- [ ] **WC-G1 — Consequence table API** — `GET /api/tournament/consequence-table?competitionId=X` returns the resolved curve, group allocation, qualification rules, and finalist count for display before launch.
- [ ] **WC-G2 — Consequence table UI** — Pre-launch admin/entrant view showing the full elimination curve, group allocation breakdown, and "this locks when PW1 locks" warning. Copy per design doc S16.1.

### Phase WC-H — 5th Classification (Pre-Tournament Stage Pick)

> Needs dedicated design session. Admin selects a knockout stage, entrants predict outcomes pre-tournament. Locks at PW1. Not path-sensitive.

- [ ] **WC-H1 — Design spike** — Define: what exactly does the entrant predict (team names reaching stage? match winners at stage? podium?), scoring model, UI for admin stage selection, UI for entrant picks. Do not write code until design is confirmed.

## Tournament Brackets (Future — Needs Design)

> **Run `/grill-with-docs` before any implementation.** Critical design decisions: (1) predict-as-you-go vs. fill-your-bracket-upfront; (2) how to handle GAA backdoor/qualifier systems vs pure single elimination; (3) automatic winner advancement vs admin-triggered; (4) whether bracket is a `CompetitionType` or a setting on existing competitions.
>
> Reference formats: NCAA March Madness (64-team pure single elimination), All Ireland Hurling (provincial rounds → All Ireland series), All Ireland Senior Football (provincial + Super 8 round-robin → knockouts).

### Phase H — Data Model

- [ ] **H1 — Design spike (grill session)** — Run `/grill-with-docs`. Define: bracket prediction mode (match-by-match vs. upfront bracket fill), GAA backdoor handling, winner propagation trigger, bracket type vs competition setting, bye handling. Do not write code until this is complete.
- [ ] **H2 — Bracket schema migration** — Add to `events`: `bracket_slot integer` (position in bracket tree, 1-indexed per round), `advances_to_event_id uuid references events(id)`, `advances_to_slot text check (in ('home','away'))`. Add `bracket_enabled boolean default false` to `competitions`. Add `bracket_round_label text` to `rounds` (e.g. "Round of 64", "Quarter-Final", "Final"). All nullable/false by default — no change to existing behaviour.
- [ ] **H3 — Bracket slot ordering util** — `src/lib/bracket.ts`: `buildBracketTree(rounds, events)` — takes flat rounds + events, returns a tree structure `BracketNode[]` suitable for rendering. Handles byes (null participants). Validates that advancement links are consistent.

### Phase I — Admin Bracket Builder

- [ ] **I1 — Bracket template definitions** — `src/lib/bracket-templates.ts`: define standard bracket shapes as slot-count-per-round arrays. Built-in templates: `single_elim_4`, `single_elim_8`, `single_elim_16`, `single_elim_32`, `single_elim_64`, `gaa_all_ireland_hurling` (QF×4 → SF×2 → F), `gaa_all_ireland_football` (QF×4 → SF×2 → F). Templates describe slot count per round and how slot winners advance — not teams.
- [ ] **I2 — Bracket competition wizard** — New admin flow for creating bracket-style competitions. Selects a template → auto-creates rounds with correct `bracket_round_label` values + placeholder events with `is_bracket_placeholder=true`. Admin fills in known teams; TBA slots remain as placeholders until rounds progress.
- [ ] **I3 — Winner advancement UI** — After admin confirms a bracket event result, show "Advance winner to next round" action. Pre-fills the winner's name into the correct slot (`advances_to_slot`) of the target event. If target event now has both teams confirmed, it becomes predictionable (clears TBA flag).
- [ ] **I4 — Bracket event management** — Extend existing admin event editing to show bracket context: which event this advances from, which event it advances to. Block deletion of events that have downstream advancement links.

### Phase J — Participant Bracket View

- [ ] **J1 — Bracket visualisation component** — `src/components/BracketTree.tsx`: renders a competition's bracket as a horizontal tree (rounds as columns, matches as nodes). Each node shows: team A vs team B (or TBA), lock status, user's pick (if any), result. Mobile-friendly — scrolls horizontally. Uses `buildBracketTree()` from H3.
- [ ] **J2 — Bracket page** — `/competitions/[id]/bracket` route. Shows `BracketTree` for bracket-enabled competitions. Linked from competition nav alongside "The Round" and leaderboard. Non-bracket competitions don't show this tab.
- [ ] **J3 — Inline prediction in bracket view** — Tapping a node in the bracket tree opens a prediction sheet (same prediction flow as existing). Locked/TBA nodes are non-interactive with clear visual state.

### Phase K — GAA-Specific Templates

- [ ] **K1 — All Ireland Hurling bracket** — Template covering the standard All Ireland series structure: 4 quarter-finals (2 provincial champions + 2 qualifiers), 2 semi-finals, 1 final. Note: provincial championship rounds (Munster, Leinster) are separate and can be modelled as standalone competitions that feed into this one — no need to model the full championship in one bracket.
- [ ] **K2 — All Ireland Football bracket** — Template for the All Ireland senior football series knockouts. Account for current format (quarter-finals onwards). Provincial stages modelled separately if needed.
- [ ] **K3 — Backdoor/qualifier pathway (stretch)** — For GAA competitions: support a "loser's path" where a first-round loser can re-enter via qualifiers. Requires `advances_loser_to_event_id` on events. Only implement after H1 design spike confirms this is in scope.

## TBA/TBC Fixture Eligibility

Fixtures with unknown participants (TBA / TBC team names from providers) should not be predictionable in personal picks or group competition events, except when explicitly part of a bracket where predicting the winner before teams are known is the point.

- [ ] **G1 — TBA detection util** — Add `hasTBAParticipant(participants: string[]): boolean` in `src/lib/sports/`. Matches case-insensitively: `"TBA"`, `"TBC"`, `"To Be Announced"`, `"To Be Confirmed"`, `""`. Used by all eligibility checks below.
- [ ] **G2 — Block personal prediction creation for TBA fixtures** — In `POST /api/personal-predictions/event`, if any participant in `config.options` matches TBA, return 422 with `{ error: "tba_fixture" }`. Fixture browser should show these as greyed-out with "Teams TBA" label instead of a pick button.
- [ ] **G3 — Block admin event creation for TBA fixtures (non-bracket)** — In `POST /api/admin/events`, if `config.options` contains TBA values and the event is not marked `is_bracket_placeholder: true`, return 422. In `AddEventForm.tsx`, show a warning when a fixture with TBA participants is selected.
- [ ] **G4 — Bracket placeholder flag** — Add `is_bracket_placeholder boolean default false` to `events` table (migration). Admin can set this when creating a bracket-style event ("Winner of Match A vs Winner of Match B"). TBA check is bypassed for these events. Bracket placeholders are locked at round lock time regardless.
- [ ] **G5 — Filter TBA fixtures from personal fixture browser** — In `PersonalFixtureBrowser.tsx`, filter out fixtures where `hasTBAParticipant` returns true before rendering the pick list. Show a count if any were hidden ("3 fixtures hidden — teams not yet confirmed").

## All-Competitions Dashboard (Future — Needs Design)

> **Note:** Run `/grill-with-docs` before implementing any of this. Significant design decisions required (card layout, data model, cross-competition aggregation, what's useful vs noisy).

A global dashboard card/view accessible from `/competitions` — giving users a high-level view across all competitions they're in, not just personal predictions.

- [ ] **F1 — Design spike (grill session)** — What does a cross-competition dashboard show? Options: recent activity across all competitions, leaderboard positions at a glance, upcoming lock times, hit rate per competition. Use `/grill-with-docs` to define scope before any implementation.
- [ ] **F2 — Dashboard card on /competitions** — A summary card on the competitions list page showing user's position and recent activity for each competition they're in. Requires deciding what data to surface.
- [ ] **F3 — Global stats** — Aggregate hit rate across all scored predictions (personal + group). Separate from personal dashboard stats.
